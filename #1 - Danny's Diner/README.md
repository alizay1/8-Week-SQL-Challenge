# Data Analysis Questions




### Question 1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

#### Approach

1. Use INNER JOIN to combine the `sales` and `menu` table in order to get the price of the menu
   item that each customer ordered.

2. To help get the total amount, select **SUM(m.price)** then GROUP BY the `customer_id`.
   
3. ORDER BY the total amount in descending order for better readability.


```sql

SELECT s.customer_id,
       SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales AS s
JOIN menu AS m
ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

```

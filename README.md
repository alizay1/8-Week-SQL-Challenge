# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge


I started learning SQL in the earlier part of this year starting from the basics to more advanced SQL concepts. After finishing Udacityâ€™s online SQL course, I found Danny Maâ€™s 8 week SQL challenge while perusing online for practice questions. Given how it touches base on different industries and offers different case study questions of varied difficulty, I thought it would be a perfect (and fun) way to test my SQL knowledge.

Join me in this ongoing effort to tackle the 8 week SQL challenge offered by Danny Ma! ðŸ¥³



**Note**: All questions were answered using PostgreSQL. Also, some answers will be updated if I come up with a better solution.
